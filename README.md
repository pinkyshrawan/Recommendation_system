Restaurant Recommendation System

This project implements a content-based recommendation system for suggesting restaurants to users based on their preferences. The system leverages user data and restaurant features to provide personalized recommendations.

Features

Data Preprocessing:

Cleans and preprocesses restaurant and user data for analysis.

Handles missing values and performs feature engineering.

Content-Based Recommendation:

Utilizes restaurant attributes such as cuisine type, price range, and user ratings.

Computes similarity scores to recommend restaurants that match user preferences.

Evaluation:

Measures the performance of the recommendation system using metrics such as precision and recall.

Visualization:

Displays insights into the data and recommendations through plots and charts.
